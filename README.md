bokehBg
=======

jQuery plugin to create and apply random bokeh backgrounds to webpage elements like `body`, `div`, etc.

To use it include the plugin and just add the following code:

  ```javascript
  $(document).ready(function(){
       $('#bgDiv').bokehBg(); //bgDiv is the id of the element to which the bokeh background will be applied
  });
  ```
  
  *Note: The generated image is just a look alike of a bokeh effect. It still needs improvemnts to emulate an exact bokeh effect*
